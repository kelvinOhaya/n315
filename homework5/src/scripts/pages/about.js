          <h2>We Started on a Trail.<br />We Built a Community.</h2>
          <p>
            Summit Ridge Outfitters was founded in 1998 by Dana Holbrook after
            completing a solo thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail. What started
            as a small gear shop in a 800-square-foot Boulder storefront has
            grown into one of Colorado's most trusted outdoor outfitters —
            but the mission hasn't changed.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that the right gear, paired with the right knowledge,
            changes people's relationship with the outdoors. Not just their
            safety, but their confidence. We've outfitted first-timers heading
            to Rocky Mountain National Park and seasoned alpinists bound for
            Denali.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every product we carry has been field-tested by our staff. Every
            recommendation comes from personal experience. That's the Summit
            Ridge difference — and it's why 87% of our new customers arrive
            referred by existing ones.
